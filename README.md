# Monte Carlo Neuron Simulation
Python module to simulate the behavior of neurons using the Kratky-Porod wormlike chain polymer model. To perform the Monte Carlo analysis, the simulation utilizes the persistence length of neurons to model their behavior in three dimensional space as they interact with a two dimensional microelectrode array that is used for in vivo studies.
